# Number guessing game

A simple number guessing game in Lean tactic mode.

## Installation

```
leanproject get foxthomson/guessgame
cd guessgame
code .
```
Open up `src/game.lean`.

## Help

I've noticed that the random numbers gennerated sometimes change mid-proof. Usually adding some whitespace at the end will make them return to their original values.
